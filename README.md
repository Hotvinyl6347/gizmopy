# Gizmo.py
Why would you want to use Python out of all things?

## Why does this exist
One day, a Python noob like me thought to myself, hmm, I think Gizmo is very gay and a JS wrapper already exists but not one for Python!!!!!!!! What the freak is this?!?!

so yeah.

# Installation #

    python3 -m pip install https://github.com/Hotvinyl6347/gizmopy.git

Then inside your python file,

    import gizmopy as gizmo

# Usage #
```python
    get_user = gizmo.get_user("Tjaz")
```

### Hopefully if my code works, you should get something like this ###
```json
       {
            "user": {
                "id": "1",
                "uid": "Tjaz",
                "rank": "Lord",
                "avatar": "https://www.gizmo.moe/assets/default.jpg",
                "header": "https://www.gizmo.moe/assets/default.jpg",
                "about": "Hello!",
                "created": "1534514387" // Seconds since epoch in UTC
                
            }
        }
```
